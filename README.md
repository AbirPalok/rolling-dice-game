# Rolling Dice Game
This game is a small web based project which mostly focused on Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## How to play
This game is played with two players. Each player gets their turn to roll two dice. On each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The sum of the rolled dice is added to the total points of that turn. After each roll the player gets the choice to either hold the points or keep rolling. If they hold the point, the total points of that turn is added to the total points and the next player gets the turn. If they choose to keep rolling, they will keep acumulating points in their turn but they will loose all the points if the both dice roll the same number and the turn goes to the next player.

Enjoy the game.
